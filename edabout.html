                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>We at STEM Synergy were inspired by the Young Pioneers enrichment program in the Soviet Union, as well as the Hemda city-wide science high school in Tel Aviv in Israel, and a similar city-wide science in Rehovot.</p>
                    <p>Under Stem power's suggestion and lab funding, the first Ethiopian SSC was established in 2014 at Kotebe Metropolitan College (“KMC”) at the eastern edge of Addis Ababa. Twenty public municipal high schools are within KMC’s surrounding catchment area, and the available science education facilities were spread too thinly among those high schools. A teacher’s college transforming to a university, KMC wanted to lead a new kind of STEM enrichment program.</p> 
                    <p>KUE(KMC back then) and STEM Synergy jointly converted an existing on-campus building to house the pioneering SSC and its labs. Then we devised a plan to select approximately five of the highest-achieving students from each of the twenty high schools. SSC students were interviewed and chosen strictly by their merit. We were particularly proud that more females than males were selected into the SSC.</p>
